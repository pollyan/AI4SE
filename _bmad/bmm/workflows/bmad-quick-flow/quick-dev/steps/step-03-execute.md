# Step 3: Execute Implementation

**Goal:** Implement all tasks, write tests, follow patterns, handle errors.

**Critical:** Continue through ALL tasks without stopping for milestones.

---

## AVAILABLE STATE

From previous steps:

- `{baseline_commit}` - Git HEAD at workflow start
- `{execution_mode}` - "tech-spec" or "direct"
- `{tech_spec_path}` - Tech-spec file (if Mode A)
- `{project_context}` - Project patterns (if exists)

From context:

- Mode A: Tasks and AC extracted from tech-spec
- Mode B: Tasks and AC from step-02 mental plan

---

## EXECUTION LOOP

For each task:

### 1. Load Context

- Read files relevant to this task
- Review patterns from project-context or observed code
- Understand dependencies

### 2. RED - Write Failing Test (TDD Step 1)

- **Stop! Do not write implementation code yet.**
- Based on the task's AC, write a minimal, failing test first.
- Run the test and explicitly verify it fails for the correct reason (not syntax error, but missing feature).

### 3. GREEN - Implement Code (TDD Step 2)

- Write the *simplest* code required to make the test pass.
- Handle errors appropriately and follow existing conventions.
- Run the test again to verify it passes (green).

### 4. REFACTOR - Clean Up (TDD Step 3)

- Clean up the code. Remove duplication, improve names, extract helpers.
- Run tests again to ensure nothing broke. 
- Run existing tests to catch regressions.

### 5. Mark Complete

- Check off task: `- [x] Task N`
- Continue to next task immediately

---

## HALT CONDITIONS

**HALT and request guidance if:**

- 3 consecutive failures on same task
- Tests fail and fix is not obvious
- Blocking dependency discovered
- Ambiguity that requires user decision

**Do NOT halt for:**

- Minor issues that can be noted and continued
- Warnings that don't block functionality
- Style preferences (follow existing patterns)

---

## CONTINUOUS EXECUTION

**Critical:** Do not stop between tasks for approval.

- Execute all tasks in sequence
- Only halt for blocking issues
- Tests failing = fix before continuing
- Track all completed work for self-check

---

## NEXT STEP

When ALL tasks are complete (or halted on blocker), read fully and follow: `{project-root}/_bmad/bmm/workflows/bmad-quick-flow/quick-dev/steps/step-04-self-check.md`.

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

- All tasks attempted
- Code follows existing patterns
- Error handling appropriate
- Tests written where appropriate
- Tests passing
- No unnecessary halts

## FAILURE MODES

- Stopping for approval between tasks
- Ignoring existing patterns
- Not running tests after changes
- Giving up after first failure
- Not following project-context rules (if exists)
